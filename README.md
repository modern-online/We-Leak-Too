# We-Leak-Too
We Leak Too, in collaboration with Leon Eckert

We Leak Too is an overly honest open-source voice assistant with an integrated packet sniffer. Every time a packet goes through its local network, the device will announce it being logged. If a plain-text packet gets intercepted, its contents are read aloud. The device otherwise acts as a regular voice assistant, serving commands, telling the wether, making lame jokes.
